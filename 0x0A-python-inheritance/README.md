## Introduction

Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming. It allows classes to inherit attributes and behaviors from parent classes, enabling code reuse and creating a hierarchical structure of classes.

This project showcases a simple implementation of inheritance in Python using a base class called `Base` and a derived class called `User`. The `User` class inherits the attributes and behaviors of the `Base` class and extends it with additional features.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   $ git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-inheritance.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```shell
   $ cd python-inheritance
   ```

3. (Optional) Set up a virtual environment:

   ```shell
   $ python -m venv venv
   $ source venv/bin/activate  # for Unix/Linux
   $ .\venv\Scripts\activate  # for Windows
   ```

4. Install the dependencies:

   ```shell
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To use the project, follow these steps:

1. Import the required classes in your Python script:

   ```python
   from base import Base
   from user import User
   ```

2. Create an instance of the `User` class:

   ```python
   u = User()
   ```

3. Access the attributes and methods inherited from the `Base` class:

   ```python
   print(u.id)
   ```

   This will output the value of the `id` attribute.
