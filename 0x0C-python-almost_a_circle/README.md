# Almost a Circle

**Almost a Circle** is a Python library that provides a set of classes and functions to work with geometric shapes resembling circles. It offers the flexibility to create objects that closely resemble circles while allowing for slight variations.

## Features

- Create objects resembling circles with adjustable parameters.
- Calculate various properties of the almost-circle objects, such as area and circumference.
- Perform operations like scaling, rotating, and comparing almost-circle objects.
- Visualize almost-circle objects using matplotlib.

## Installation

You can install **Almost a Circle** using pip:

```
pip install almost-a-circle
```

## Usage

Here's a basic example that demonstrates how to create an almost-circle object, calculate its area, and visualize it:

```python
from almost_a_circle import AlmostCircle
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create an almost-circle object with radius 5 and deviation 0.2
circle = AlmostCircle(radius=5, deviation=0.2)

# Calculate the area
area = circle.calculate_area()

print("Area:", area)

# Visualize the almost-circle
circle.visualize()

# Show the plot
plt.show()
```
