# Python Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) README

## Introduction

Welcome to the Python Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library! This library is designed to simplify database interaction within Python applications by providing an abstraction layer that allows you to work with your database using Python objects.

## Installation

To install the Python ORM library, you can use pip, Python's package manager. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
pip install python-orm-library
```

## Usage

Using this ORM library in your Python application is straightforward. You'll need to follow these steps:

1. **Import the Library**: Import the ORM library in your Python script or application.

```python
from orm_library import ORM
```

2. **Initialize the ORM**: Create an instance of the ORM and configure it to connect to your database.

```python
orm = ORM(database_url="your_database_url_here")
```

3. **Define Your Data Models**: Create Python classes that represent your database tables. Use class attributes to define the table columns.

```python
class User(orm.Model):
    id = orm.Column(orm.Integer, primary_key=True)
    username = orm.Column(orm.String(50), unique=True)
    email = orm.Column(orm.String(100), unique=True)
```

4. **Perform Database Operations**: Use the ORM to perform various database operations like querying, inserting, updating, and deleting records.

```python
# Example: Insert a new user into the database
new_user = User(username="john_doe", email="john@example.com")
orm.session.add(new_user)
orm.session.commit()
```

5. **Query Data**: Use the ORM to query data from the database using Pythonic syntax.

```python
# Example: Query all users with a specific email
users_with_email = User.query.filter_by(email="john@example.com").all()
```

6. **Close the ORM Session**: Don't forget to close the ORM session when you're done.

```python
orm.session.close()
```

## Features

- **Database Abstraction**: Allows you to work with databases without writing SQL queries directly.
- **Data Modeling**: Define your data models as Python classes.
- **Querying**: Use Pythonic syntax to query the database.
- **Transactions**: Supports transaction management for safe database operations.
- **Database Support**: Compatible with various database systems like PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and more.
- **Schema Migrations**: Supports schema migrations to evolve your database over time.
