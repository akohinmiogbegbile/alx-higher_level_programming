# Test-Driven Development with Python

This repository demonstrates the principles and practices of Test-Driven Development (TDD) using Python. TDD is a software development approach that emphasizes writing tests before writing the actual code. It helps ensure that the code is thoroughly tested, reliable, and maintainable.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the instructions below:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-name.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd project-name`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the tests: `pytest`

## Project Structure

The project has the following structure:

```
project-name/
  ├── app/
  │   ├── __init__.py
  │   └── module.py
  ├── tests/
  │   ├── __init__.py
  │   └── test_module.py
  ├── README.md
  └── requirements.txt
```

- `app/`: This directory contains the main Python code of the project.
- `tests/`: This directory contains the test cases for the project.
- `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the project and instructions for getting started.
- `requirements.txt`: This file lists the required dependencies for the project.

## Writing Tests

The project follows the pytest framework for writing and running tests. Test files should be placed in the `tests/` directory and should have the prefix `test_`.

To write a test, follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary modules and functions.
2. Define a test function with a name that describes what is being tested.
3. Write the assertions to verify the expected behavior of the code.
4. Run the tests using the `pytest` command.

## Running Tests

To run the tests, use the following command in the project directory:

```
pytest
```

The pytest framework will discover all the test files in the `tests/` directory and execute them, providing detailed information about any test failures.

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome. If you find any issues or want to suggest improvements, please open an issue or submit a pull request. Ensure that your code changes include appropriate test coverage and follow the project's coding guidelines.
